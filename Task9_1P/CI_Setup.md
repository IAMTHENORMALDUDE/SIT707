# Continuous Integration (CI) Setup Guide

## Overview

This project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI). The CI pipeline automatically builds the project, runs tests, and generates reports whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

## CI Configuration

The CI configuration is defined in the `.github/workflows/maven.yml` file. This file specifies the steps that GitHub Actions will perform when the workflow is triggered.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Checkout Code**: The workflow checks out the latest code from the repository.
2. **Set up JDK**: Sets up Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 for building and testing the project.
3. **Build with Maven**: Compiles the Java code using Maven.
4. **Test with Maven**: Runs all unit tests to ensure code quality.
5. **Upload Test Results**: Uploads the test results as artifacts for review.

## Triggering the CI Pipeline

The CI pipeline is triggered automatically when:

- Code is pushed to the `main` or `master` branch
- A pull request is created targeting the `main` or `master` branch

## Monitoring Build Status

### Build Success

When a build succeeds, GitHub Actions will send a notification indicating that all steps have completed successfully. This means:

- The code compiled without errors
- All tests passed
- The project artifacts were built successfully

### Build Failure

When a build fails, GitHub Actions will send a notification indicating which step failed. Common reasons for build failures include:

- Compilation errors
- Test failures
- Missing dependencies

## Viewing Build Results

You can view the build results in the GitHub repository under the "Actions" tab. This provides detailed information about each build, including:

- Build logs
- Test results
- Code coverage reports (generated by JaCoCo)

## Benefits of CI

1. **Early Detection of Issues**: Problems are identified as soon as they are introduced.
2. **Consistent Builds**: Ensures that the project builds consistently across different environments.
3. **Automated Testing**: Tests are run automatically, reducing the risk of human error.
4. **Improved Collaboration**: Team members can see the impact of their changes on the project.
5. **Quality Assurance**: Maintains high code quality by enforcing passing tests.
